NOT FIXED:
p 264, second instruction: I found it very hard to follow the instructions because
firstly, the seaside approach is so different from anything else I've ever used and secondly, there is no code example illustrating a possible solution. I had to load the example code to understand what the instructions actually meant (which is not really the issue though. I just feel that the difficulty level is not consistent with the rest of the coding examples)
p 266: square brackets sometimes have a space before (after) them, sometimes they don't. This inconsistency is found all over the book

p 43. Lights Out toggles cells if you move the mouse between clicking and releasing. Fix is to override inherited SimpleSwitchMorph>>mouseMove: with an empty method.
- fixed

- fixed

p 5. QuickTour: before 'First Interaction.' paragraph, {\sf x} should be the red
button on the window title bar (OS X style by default?); we probably
should remove all X for closing windows
- fixed; added description of orange and green buttons
p 33. FirstApp: "The bottom pane of the inspector is a mini-workspace.  It's useful
because in this workspace the pseudo-variable \self is bound to the
object being inspected. "
- fixed to "object selected"
p 43. "The simplest way of doing this is by \emph{filing out} the code.
The \actclick menu in the System Categories pane will give you the
option to file out the whole of category \scat{PBE-LightsOut}."
- fixed to refer to Package Browser (menu: various>file out)
p 46. In 'Saving and loading code with Monticello': "What is a package?..."
We added a 'Categories & Packages' subsection; no need to say that or reformulate it
- deleted obsolete paragraph
p 318 FAQ: "How do I register the browser that I want to be the default?"
it's on the right not on the left now
- fixed
p 93 Model: remove words about MVC in Model.tex / I did it in
Morph>>openInWorld
- fixed (mb)

p.34 Bounds in inspector don't change until we refresh with action-click refresh in inspector pane
- replaced old inspector image and fixed text

p.10 Bouncing Morph not working for me – probably due to morph package
- fixed in the latest image
p. 14 Screenshot
- fixed
p.15 Found confusing how to change the default browser. Screenshot would help.
- FAQ 5 has a screenshot
p.33 inspector screenshot changed.
- fixed
p.33. Make sure you select a LOCell at the root of the tree before executing “self bound: (...)”
- fixed
p. 43 Game not working for me – probably due to morph package
- it works now
p. 43 Specify where is “file out” command (various > fileOut)
- fixed
p.51 Make clear that #( 27 #(true false) abc ) is equivalent to #(27 #(true false) #abc) or #(27 (true false) abc)
- fixed
p.106 Where is the “message names” tool?
- Hm. It seems to be labeled "Method Search" now in the tools menu. I have reported it.
p.111 Screenshot: refactoring missing in pharo
- in the latest image it is fixed
p.112. AtomMorph missing – probably due to morph package
- ok now
p.112 Implementors: if only one match in class browser, opens it directly, no intermediate window.
- ok
p.126 Screenshot.
- fixed
p.126 Where is “all inst vars” in the left pane?
- rewrote the description to fit the new inspector
p.127 Evalution of  “jdn := jdn -1” works only if root of tree is selected
- fixed
p.130-133 Debugger screenshot not the same
- fixed all debugger screenshots and revised text to be consistent with current version
p.137 Where is “message names”?
- strangely this is called "method search" in the tools menu
p.148 Code snippet should have “TestCase” instead of “Object” ?
- fixed
p. 155  Typo: “Both individual TestCases and TestSuite <new line> s understand the same protocol” 
- fixed
p. 211 ^ stream next instead of ^ self next ?
- fixed
p. 294 Screenshot: pharo has button on the implementor window.  If we show the implementer programmatically, we don't get the same window as if we use "browse > implementors" in class browser.
- annoying -- will be fixed when we settle on a single browser
p. 310 MorphObjectOut missing – probably due to morph package
* to be fixed ...
General:
(1)	Stack is a popular construction. How does it fit in the collection hierarchy?
(2)	Stream are presented as a way to navigate collection. From my point of view, stream are important not to navigate collection, but to produce/consume data:
(a)	memory constraint. Data can not hold into memory and must be processed in a stream fashion, e.g: encryption
(b)	blocking IO. A stream is a nice abstraction to deal with, and the stream manages internally data availability, buffering, etc. to simplify the consumption/production of data
Only few streams have random access capability.
(3)  I would not use reflection to call faceX on p.234. A statically filled Dictionary would be more appropriate. Get the point set with “MyDict at: X”.
- above comments integrated into the various chapters as editorial notes
(4) Implementation of future in Smalltalk according to http://onsmalltalk.com/smalltalk-concurrency-playing-with-futures would be a nice concluding example of Smalltalk power.
