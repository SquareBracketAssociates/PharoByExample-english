# Important
The chapters for Pharo by example Two have been moved to <https:/scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/pharobooks/PharoByExampleTwo-Eng/>.
The chapters for Pharo by example one are still managed on this git repository so that translators may pull requests.

# Pharo by Example

This is the LaTeX source repository of the _Pharo by Example_ books 1 and 2.

The public web site of the books is: <http://pharobyexample.org/>

All the source repos live here: <http://github.com/SquareBracketAssociates/>

See PBE-TO-DO.txt for status of tasks for PBE 1 and 2.

# File structure

The main file is PBE1.tex (resp. PBE2.tex).  Chapters are in subdirectories.
You can latex either the entire book, or each individual chapter.
Each chapter file starts and ends with the same incantation
which will optionally include macros or end the document if it is
latexed individually.

Use the \ct{} macro for in-line code.
Use the {method} {classdef} {example} and {script} environments for
multi-line code.

If you add a new chapter: 
-	please be sure to include it from PBE1.tex.
-	Remember to include its /figures/ subdirectory in the graphicspath,
	   which is set in the preamble to PBE1.tex.  Don't forget the trailing /
-	Please make sure the chapter compiles with latex both from the main book
	and as a separate chapter.  
-	Set the svn:ignore property on the chapter's directory.  The command to do
	this is svn propset svn:ignore -F .svnignore <directory name>

IMPORTANT: Please check out a fresh copy of the book and compile the book
to verify that you have added all the dependent files (e.g., figures).

## Makefile

To build the PDF of the book, simply run "make" in the Book folder.
Be sure you have texlive installed (see below).

## Printing

The book has been reformatted to 6"x9" (for Lulu). If you want to print any
part of the book, you will find that printing 2 up at 140% works well.

# Testing

Tests are automatically generated from the LaTeX sources.

Grab a recent Pharo image and move it to the folder Pharo book folder.  Do *not* use a 1-click image, since the actual image should be located at the same level as the PBE1.tex file.

To run the tests, load the package PBE-Testing from the following SqueakSource project:

	MCHttpRepository
	    location: 'http://www.squeaksource.com/PharoByExample'
	    user: ''
	    password: ''

Then evaluate the following expression in a workspace:

	PBEmain new runTests

For PBE2, instead run:

	PBE2main new runTests

This will automatically extract and run the tests in the LaTeX sources of the Pharo by Example book.  It will also load the hands-on exercises, and check that they are working. (Some tests may also be included from the dependent hands-on packages.)

This will parse (using Regex) the PBE1.tex (resp. PBE2.tex) to locate the included chapter files, parse each chapter file to search for @TEST annotations, generate test case classes for each chapter with tests in a new category PBE-GeneratedTests, and generate a test method (numbered by the line number in the chapter) for each test found.  (NB: Any old generated tests are removed before new ones are generated.) Finally, by sending "runTests", a TestRunner is opened on the new category, and all those tests are run.

## How to write tests in LaTeX

A sample test in the BasicClasses looks like this:

	=\begin{code}{@TEST}
	=a1 := { { 'harry' } } .
	=a2 := a1 shallowCopy.
	=(a1 at: 1) at: 1 put: 'sally'.
	=(a2 at: 1) at: 1 --> 'sally'
	=\end{code}

The "print it" invocation (-->) will generate an assertion.

The generated source code looks like this:

	=test204
	=	a1 := { { 'harry' } } .
	=	a2 := a1 shallowCopy.
	=	(a1 at: 1) at: 1 put: 'sally'.
	=	self assert: [ (a2 at: 1) at: 1  ] value printString = '''sally'''

You may also silently declare or initialize variables immediately after @TEST,
and you may now place comments after the test string:

	=\begin{code}{@TEST |a b|}
	=a := b := 'hello'.
	=a == b --> true "two variables but one object"
	=\end{code}

The generated testCase subclass is PBEBasicClassesTestCase.

The generated tests can be removed by evaluating "PBEmain removeOldTestCategory". This is done automatically whenever you do "PBEmain new runTests".

# LaTeX version

Please use at least texlive 2005.
http://www.tug.org/texlive/
If you are using TeXshop or another GUI, be sure to set the path to the tex executables.  E.g., in TeXShop>Preferences>Engine set the path to:
/usr/local/texlive/2005/bin/powerpc-darwin

For intel macs you will need texlive 2007.  The path should be
/usr/local/texlive/2007/bin/i386-darwin

## OmniGraffle files

Please be sure to use Lucida Sans, not Helvetica, or you may have problems
uploading the PDF to Lulu.  See the font embedding FAQ on lulu.com
See more detailed instructions in Cover/README.txt

## Style files

To inform latex about the location of local style files, set the following environment variable (tcsh):

	setenv TEXINPUTS ./local//:../local//:
		or (bash):
	export TEXINPUTS=./local//:../local//:

If you are using a GUI like TeXshop, you must set the environment variable in ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist :

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
	<plist version="1.0">
	<dict>
		<key>TEXINPUTS</key>
		<string>./local//:../local//:</string>
	</dict>
	</plist>
 
NB: You may need to logout and login again after creating or modifying this file.
Note colon at end of TEXINPUTS that means "append current value here"
(eg local has higher priority). Double slash means search recursively.

# Bibliography

The bibliography file scg.bib is available from a separate git repository:

	git clone git@scg.unibe.ch:scgbib

Alternatively, you can check out a read-only version as follows:

	git clone git://scg.unibe.ch/scgbib

You should separately check out this file and link it in wherever it is needed.
